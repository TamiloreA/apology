      <h2>My Anambra Girl,</h2>
      <p>I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for not responding to you early enough. I know that my actions have caused you to be very pissed at me, and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
      <p>I want you to know that it was never my intention to make you this pissed. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand the impact they have had on you.</p>
      <p>Please I want you to know that I deeply regret my behavior and the pain it has caused. I value our relationship and the trust you have placed in me, and I am committed to making amends and ensuring that this does not happen again in the future.</p>
      <p>Once again, I apologize for my actions and any anger it may have caused you. I hope we can find a way to move forward from this and rebuild our relationship. I really cherish it.</p>
      <p>I understand if you don't want to talk to me agian. I deserve that.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Your Badman</p>
